Aiming at the application scenario where low-dimension parameters are used to characterize anomaly states of system, we propose LGMAD algorithm. Based on the univariate anomaly detection using our designed LSTM-BP algorithm, the Gaussian model is used to perform the anomaly detection for multivariate time series data. Our algorithm can be applied to anomaly detection for general field without any prior anomaly knowledge, and it can also improve anomaly detection rate effectively and has the same good temporal performance and can adapt to the anomaly detection requirements for current multivariate time series data. After experimental comparison, LGMAD algorithm can perform better than HTM algorithm, and is also superior to LSTM-based Predictive Data Model algorithm.
